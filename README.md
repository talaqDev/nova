# Financial News Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing financial news data to discover correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. By combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) with statistical and financial analysis, the goal is to enhance predictive analytics capabilities for stock price forecasting.

## Objectives
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Extract sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from financial news headlines to understand market sentiment.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Determine statistical relationships between news sentiment and stock price changes.
3. **Insights for Strategy**: Develop actionable insights to guide investment strategies using sentiment and stock movement data.

## Dataset
- **Financial News Dataset**: Contains fields such as `headline`, `url`, `publisher`, `date`, and `stock`.
- **Stock Price Data**: Includes columns like `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, and `Volume`.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Git and GitHub Setup
- Set up a version-controlled environment with GitHub.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):
  - Analyze article lengths, publishing trends, and active publishers.
  - Extract keywords and perform basic sentiment analysis.

### Task 2: Quantitative Financial Analysis
- Load and preprocess stock price data.
- Calculate technical indicators using libraries like `TA-Lib` and `PyNance`.
- Visualize data trends and merge stock data with sentiment scores.

### Task 3: Correlation Analysis
- Align news and stock data by dates.
- Calculate daily stock returns and sentiment scores.
- Perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between sentiment and stock performance.

## Key Deliverables
1. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Well-structured project directory.
   - Branches for each task (`task-1`, `task-2`, etc.).
   - Regular, descriptive commits.
2. **Interim Report**:
   - 3-page summary of initial findings (due 13 Dec 2024).
3. **Final Report**:
   - 10-page detailed report with insights, methodologies, and up to 10 plots (due 17 Dec 2024).

## Technologies and Tools
- **Programming**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, TA-Lib, PyNance, NLTK, TextBlob
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Dates
- **Challenge Start**: 11 Dec 2024
- **Interim Submission**: 13 Dec 2024 (8:00 PM UTC)
- **Final Submission**: 17 Dec 2024 (8:00 PM UTC)
